# WordPlay

WordPlay is a simple game in which there are two players who are given a random set of three vowels and 6 other letters. the goal of the game is to create the highest scoring words. The more letters you use, the more points it will be. If the letter is more infrequent in use, it will be worth more points, just like in Scrabble.

Point values are as follows:

(1) - A, E, I, O, U, L, N, S, T, R
(2) - D, G
(3) - B, C, M, P
(4) - F, H, V, W, Y
(5) - K
(8) - J, X
(10) - Q, Z

For every letter you use, that letter will dissapear from your hand for the next round.

5 rounds are played. 

Best score wins!
